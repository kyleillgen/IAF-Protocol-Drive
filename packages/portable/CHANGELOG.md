# IAF Protocol rename (unreleased source)

- Public identity is IAF Protocol (It's All Files), formerly AgentOS.
- Added Install-IAF.ps1 and iaf-init entry points; existing entry points remain compatible.
- Existing 0.2.1 release archives, names, hashes and historical notes below remain unchanged.

# Changes

## 0.2.1 — early preview

- First-run guide, read-only doctor, and a helper that prepares a uniquely named local greeting task without publishing or launching it.
- Installation preflight rejects overlapping ledger/workspace paths, junctions, wildcard folder names, hidden runtime history and directory collisions before configuring.
- BOM-free UTF-8 process input on Windows UTF-8 locales, verified with native ASCII/non-English byte round-trips; original console settings restored.
- Serialized setup and atomic configuration replacement; existing installations and ledgers remain protected.
- Versioned downloads, MIT license in both bundles, explicit template file inventory and release checks.
- Windows CI exercises source scaffolding, both extracted install paths, diagnostics and the runtime with fake CLIs.
- Foreground login/model access and clean-machine/scheduled/signed-out checks remain receiving-machine validation, not claims made by mechanical tests.

## 0.2.0

Added the native Windows PowerShell dispatcher and matched manual and agent-assisted downloads.

## 0.1.0

Initial file-based workspace, protocol, templates, worked example and optional Node scaffold command.
